-- The reservation sweep, in the database.
--
-- There used to be an always-on worker process doing this on a 30-second timer.
-- It is gone, because an always-on process is the one thing a free serverless
-- deploy cannot have, and because the timer was never the real mechanism: a
-- queued job can be lost, a query over the orders table cannot miss a row that
-- is sitting in it.
--
-- Expiry now has two triggers. The API sweeps lazily at the start of every
-- checkout, which is the one that matters — a stale reservation only costs
-- anything when it is standing between a customer and stock they want. This
-- function is the backstop, so orders still reach EXPIRED with zero traffic and
-- the admin's numbers stay honest.
--
-- Putting it here rather than behind an HTTP endpoint and an external cron
-- service means no shared secret to leak, no third-party scheduler to depend on,
-- and no network hop between the logic and the rows it operates on. The backstop
-- travels with the database, so a clone of this repo gets it for free.
