# Run the integration lane end to end: migrate, boot the API, run the suite,
# shut the API down again.
#
# This exists because the sequence is fiddly and easy to get subtly wrong (the
# suite silently passing against a stale API is the failure mode), and because a
# flow run by hand twice should be a command the third time.
#
# Rate limits are raised for the run. The suite fires twenty concurrent
# checkouts from one address, which a production-shaped per-IP budget is
# supposed to refuse. Raising them here keeps the production defaults honest
# instead of weakening them to make a test pass.
#
# Usage: ./scripts/integration.sh
# Assumes Postgres and Redis are up (infra/docker-compose.yml).
