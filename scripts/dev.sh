# Start the dev stack: load .env, check the datastores are reachable, hand off to
# turbo.
#
# This exists because `turbo run dev` on its own does not read .env. Turbo does
# not load dotenv files, and Next.js only reads a .env inside its own package
# directory (apps/web/.env), which this monorepo does not have. So the documented
# command started an API with no AUTH_SECRET, which died at boot, and a web app
# whose every server render then failed with ECONNREFUSED against a dead :4000.
# The failure read as "the page is slow" because what the browser was waiting on
# was dev compilation followed by a render that never produced HTML.
#
# The env-loading block below is deliberately the same shape as the one in
# scripts/e2e.sh, so the repo has one idiom for this rather than two that can
# drift apart.
#
# Usage: pnpm dev   (package.json points "dev" here)
